# Abstract
Angkor, Cambodia (c. 800–1400 CE), is often considered a flagship example of ancient low-density urbanism, sometimes referred to as 'agro-urbanism.' Unlike high-density urban centers, such as medieval market towns or Mesopotamian cities like Uruk, agro-urban settlements integrate urban and agricultural spaces without clear boundaries. Despite the conceptual distinction between these different forms of urbanism, few studies have quantitatively evaluated Angkor’s classification or investigated the spatial structure of ancient low-density agro-urban settlement regions more broadly. In this study, we applied a novel spatial point-pattern analysis, implemented in an open-source Python package called `ChronoCluster`, to examine the structure of Angkor and compare it with medieval Hampshire, England, based on historical Domesday survey data (c. 1086 CE). Our analysis accounts for spatial and temporal uncertainties, and change over time in point pattern configurations, enabling continuous modeling of spacetime patterns in archaeological settlement systems. Surprisingly, we found striking structural similarities between Angkor and Hampshire, challenging the notion of distinct urban forms in the past. We hypothesize that Angkor’s urban system reflects a scaled-down version of Hampshire’s, shaped by differences in modal transportation (horseback vs. pedestrian). These findings raise broader questions about the differentiation of urban phenomena and suggest a scaling relationship between transportation speed and urban settlement structure.
