## Software
The scripts and notebooks contained in this repository are intended for replication efforts and to improve the transparency of research. They are, of course, provided without warranty or technical support. That said, questions about the code can be directed to me, Chris Carleton, at ccarleton@protonmail.com.

It also heavily used a new package called [ChronoCluster](https://wccarleton.me/chronocluster/). The version of ChronoCluster relevant to this repository and the associated paper has been archived with Zenodo and can be referenced as follows:
